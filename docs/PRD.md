## üéØ Pro Tips for Maximum Velocity

1. **Parallel Development**
   - Frontend dev works on UI while backend processes
   - Use mock data extensively
   - Deploy features behind flags

2. **AI-First Approach**
   - Let Claude Code design algorithms
   - Use Cursor for rapid prototyping
   - MCPs for all external services

3. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging on every commit
   - Production deploys 2x per week
   - Feature flags for gradual rollout

4. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Beta users from day 1
   - Weekly demos to surveyors
   - Iterate based on real usage

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **OCR Accuracy**: Always have Claude Vision as backup
- **Performance**: Cache aggressively, optimize later
- **Scaling**: Design for horizontal scaling from start

### Development Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to PRD priorities
- **AI Limitations**: Always provide manual overrides
- **Integration Issues**: Build adapters, not tight coupling

---

**Remember:** The goal is to ship fast and iterate. Use AI to accelerate development, not perfect every feature. Your surveyor users want a working tool, not perfect code!
